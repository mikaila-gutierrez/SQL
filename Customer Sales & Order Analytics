# In the following SQL sequence, I am querying a database with a few different, but related, tables in order to quantify statistics about customer orders and company sales

--How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for eah product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101? How many? Revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity),product,SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 3 products at a time, and what was the avg amount spent?

SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';
